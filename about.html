<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I am a performance-focused digital marketer with hands-on experience in
  Google Ads, SEO, analytics, and conversion optimization. I help brands
  grow by focusing on data, ROI, and measurable results.
</p>

<p>
  I have worked with agencies and digital brands where I managed SEO and
  paid campaigns, improved website visibility, reduced acquisition costs,
  and aligned marketing efforts with business goals.
</p>

<p>
  I am especially interested in performance-driven industries such as
  fintech, trading, and online services where strategy and execution
  matter equally.
